# Project-NaturalLanguageProcessing-Kashyap_Suratia 

Applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also employed fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words ,phrases .organizations and entities mentioned in the articles and social posts.

Completed the following tasks:

1) Sentiment Analysis.
2) Natural Language Processing.( NLTK , Ngrams, wordcloud etc ).
3) Named Entity Recognition.
